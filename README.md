# QA-certification-project
This is my first solo QA project for the certification exam. July 2023

Book Store Application: https://demoqa.com/login

QA Test Management Tool: QA Touch https://www.qatouch.com/

My objective was to simulate a real life testing scenario by following these steps:
- writing the requirements for the application after applying exploratory testing
- create a test plan
- write test cases and cover as much as possible of the functional features (a minimum of 3 functional test cases were mandatory)
- link test cases to requirements 
- run the test cases and note all defects and improvements
- generate summaries and reports

What have I learned?

At first I thought, since I chose a simple application, that I will be able to test all functional features. While creating the test cases by covering the requirements - with mostly positive cases - I have realised that testing the whole application requires significantly more time and the end result might be a bit sloppy. So I turned my priorities towards a more in depth testing two important features, the registration and login.
I have learned that it is important to know how and what to prioritise and maybe test one functionality inside and out, thoroughly, but keeping in mint that _exhaustive testing is impossible_. 
I loved the whole work process, the findings, thought processes behind it, and all A-HA! moments.

Software testing can be very complex and exciting!
